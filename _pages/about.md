I am a PhD student and research/teaching assistant at the [Laboratory for Mechatronic Systems (LAMES)](https://lames.fer.hr/), which is part of the Department of Electric Machines, Drives and Automation, at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER)](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en), [University of Zagreb](https://www.unizg.hr/homepage/), Croatia.

My supervisor is [Šandor Ileš](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/sandor.iles) and my research currently focuses on predictive control of vehicle dynamics. In order to improve safety and energy efficiency of modern electric vehicles, we combine classic control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) with machine learning tools such as reinforcement learning (RL). By leveraging the benefits of both physics-based and data-driven methods, we aim to improve the properties of vehicle control systems such as active steering, traction control or torque vectoring.

Recently I have also been collaborating with the group of [Sébastien Gros](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/sebastien.gros) at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/) in Trondheim, Norway. This work is focused on extending the MPC-based RL algorithms to exploit similarities between dynamical systems of different sizes, based on dimensional analysis.

I am also involved in teaching through the courses [Fundamentals of Mechatronics](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/fom_b), [Control Techniques in Mechatronics](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/ctim) and [Vehicle Dynamics and Control](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/course/vdac), where I take care of the tutorial sessions and laboratory exercises.

Finally, I support open science and try to contribute to open-source projects such as [acados](https://docs.acados.org/) and [leap-c](https://leap-c.github.io/leap-c/).
